ScrollDownWebViewSample
=======================

Still needs to support fling, but in the meantime it can consume and pass down touches to mimic the Chrome URL bar showing / hiding.

Load a web page as normal with the top bar showing.

Then scroll up and you'll hide the bar and then scrolls will be fed into the WebView.
